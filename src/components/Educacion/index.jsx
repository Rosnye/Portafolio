                    I hold a certification from Alura Latam in Front-End development, specializing in React JS. 
                    My educational background encompasses four years of programming experience, 
                    with the last six months dedicated to honing my expertise in Front-End development using React. 
                    Additionally, I have gained proficiency in back-end development with Java. 
                    My proficiency extends to version control with Git and GitHub, 
                    facilitating efficient collaborative coding processes. 
                    I have also effectively utilized tools such as Figma and Trello for team organization and project management, 
                    ensuring streamlined workflows and successful project delivery.
